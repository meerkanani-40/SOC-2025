# SOC 2025: Web Development Basics – Learning Log

## Overview

This repository documents my learning journey in **SOC 2025**, a course focused on the fundamentals of web development. As of now, I have explored and practiced **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Bootstrap**. These technologies form the foundation of front-end web development and have enabled me to create responsive and structured web pages.

## 📚 What I've Learned

### 1. HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
- Learned how to structure web pages using semantic tags like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`, etc.
- Practiced elements such as:
  - Text elements: `<h1>` to `<h6>`, `<p>`, `<span>`, `<strong>`, `<em>`, etc.
  - Lists: `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`
  - Links: `<a href="">`
  - Images and media: `<img>`, `<video>`, `<audio>`
  - Forms: `<form>`, `<input>`, `<label>`, `<textarea>`, `<select>`, `<button>`

### 2. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
- Learned how to style HTML elements using:
  - Selectors: class, id, element, group
  - Properties: `color`, `background-color`, `margin`, `padding`, `border`, `font-size`, etc.
  - Layout techniques using `display: flex`, `grid`, and `position`
  - Pseudo-classes like `:hover`, `:nth-child`, `:first-child`, etc.
  - External, internal, and inline CSS usage

### 3. Bootstrap (v5.x)
- Gained experience in using a CSS framework to build responsive, mobile-first websites
- Learned about the Bootstrap grid system and breakpoints
- Used built-in components like:
  - Navbar
  - Cards
  - Buttons
  - Modals
  - Alerts
  - Forms
- Applied Bootstrap utility classes for spacing, alignment, text formatting, and responsiveness
